Kanchenjunga is a font family for the Kirat Rai script of South Asia. It is named after the third highest mountain in the world.

_The Kirat Rai script was officially encoded in the Unicode Standard version 17.0. Kanchenjunga version 1.000 was released in 2023 with provisional codepoints. However, those codepoints did not change, so if you used Kanchenjunga version 1.000, no data conversion will be necessary._

#### Changes

- Official release of Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold using official Unicode codepoints
- Added support for TypeTuner
