## About this project

Kanchenjunga Test A is a font in development for the Kirat Rai script. **Please note that this is a work in progress so glyph shapes, metrics, and encoding will change.**

_Please note that this font is not yet encoded according to The Unicode Standard, as the Kirat Rai script has not yet been accepted into the standard. The letters are currently given temporary assignments while encoding proposals are in process. Once the script is accepted into Unicode the encoding assignments may change._



## Future plans

This font will have an official release once the script has been encoded in Unicode.

Please send us your requests using the [form on the font website](https://software.sil.org/kanchenjunga/about/contact/). If you are interested in helping us make the font better see the [Developer](developer.md) page.
