#### *Where does the name Kanchenjunga come from?*

Kanchenjunga is world’s third highest mountain situated on the border between Sikkim state, and eastern Nepal. Etymology of this name is found in Britannica: The name Kanchenjunga is derived from four words of Tibetan origin, usually rendered Kang-chen-dzo-nga or Yang-chhen-dzö-nga and interpreted in Sikkim as the “Five Treasuries of the Great Snow.” This peak represents the geographical distribution of the Bantawa language quite well.

#### *How is this font different from v1.000 which was released before it was officially in the Unicode Standard?*

The Kirat Rai script was officially encoded in the Unicode Standard version 17.0. Kanchenjunga version 1.000 was released in 2023 with provisional codepoints. However, those codepoints did not change, so if you used Kanchenjunga version 1.000, no data conversion will be necessary. The only difference is that the font now includes a Medium and SemiBold weight in addition to the Regular and Bold that were released with version 1.000.

#### *I used a Kirat Rai font which was custom encoded. How can I convert my data from the custom encoding to Unicode?*

Data which was created with the a custom encoded font will not be automatically converted to Unicode by switching fonts. The data must be converted to Unicode using a data conversion routine. See "Text conversion" in [Resources](resources.md) for information on converting your data.

#### *I have text in Bantawa using the Devanagari script. How can I convert my data from Devanagari to Kirat Rai?*

A TECKit converter to convert text from Devanagari script to Kirat Rai is available. See "Text conversion" in [Resources](resources.md) for information on converting your data.
