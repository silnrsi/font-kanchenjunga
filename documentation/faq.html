    <h4 id="where-does-the-name-kanchenjunga-come-from"><em>Where does the name Kanchenjunga come from?</em></h4>
    <p>Kanchenjunga is world’s third highest mountain situated on the border between Sikkim state, and eastern Nepal. Etymology of this name is found in Britannica: The name Kanchenjunga is derived from four words of Tibetan origin, usually rendered Kang-chen-dzo-nga or Yang-chhen-dzö-nga and interpreted in Sikkim as the “Five Treasuries of the Great Snow.” This peak represents the geographical distribution of the Bantawa language quite well.</p>
    <h4 id="since-the-kirat-rai-script-is-not-officially-in-the-unicode-standard-what-are-the-problems-i-might-encounter"><em>Since the Kirat Rai script is not officially in the Unicode Standard, what are the problems I might encounter?</em></h4>
    <p>This font is using codepoints that are not officially in the Unicode Standard. The Kirat Rai script has been accepted for encoding into the standard, but those codepoints can always change. Once the script is in a published version of Unicode the encoding assignments may change. If you use this font, and codepoints are changed, this font will be updated and your data will need converting to the new codepoints.</p>
