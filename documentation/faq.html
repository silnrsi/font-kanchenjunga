    <h4 id="where-does-the-name-kanchenjunga-come-from"><em>Where does
    the name Kanchenjunga come from?</em></h4>
    <p>Kanchenjunga is world’s third highest mountain situated on the
    border between Sikkim state, and eastern Nepal. Etymology of this
    name is found in Britannica: The name Kanchenjunga is derived from
    four words of Tibetan origin, usually rendered Kang-chen-dzo-nga or
    Yang-chhen-dzö-nga and interpreted in Sikkim as the “Five Treasuries
    of the Great Snow.” This peak represents the geographical
    distribution of the Bantawa language quite well.</p>
    <h4
    id="how-is-this-font-different-from-v1.000-which-was-released-before-it-was-officially-in-the-unicode-standard"><em>How
    is this font different from v1.000 which was released before it was
    officially in the Unicode Standard?</em></h4>
    <p>The Kirat Rai script was officially encoded in the Unicode
    Standard version 17.0. Kanchenjunga version 1.000 was released in
    2023 with provisional codepoints. However, those codepoints did not
    change, so if you used Kanchenjunga version 1.000, no data
    conversion will be necessary. The only difference is that the font
    now includes a Medium and SemiBold weight in addition to the Regular
    and Bold that were released with version 1.000.</p>
    <h4
    id="i-used-a-kirat-rai-font-which-was-custom-encoded.-how-can-i-convert-my-data-from-the-custom-encoding-to-unicode"><em>I
    used a Kirat Rai font which was custom encoded. How can I convert my
    data from the custom encoding to Unicode?</em></h4>
    <p>Data which was created with the a custom encoded font will not be
    automatically converted to Unicode by switching fonts. The data must
    be converted to Unicode using a data conversion routine. See "Text
    conversion" in <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> for
    information on converting your data.</p>
    <h4
    id="i-have-text-in-bantawa-using-the-devanagari-script.-how-can-i-convert-my-data-from-devanagari-to-kirat-rai"><em>I
    have text in Bantawa using the Devanagari script. How can I convert
    my data from Devanagari to Kirat Rai?</em></h4>
    <p>A TECKit converter to convert text from Devanagari script to
    Kirat Rai is available. See "Text conversion" in <a
    href="resources.html">Resources</a> for information on converting
    your data.</p>
