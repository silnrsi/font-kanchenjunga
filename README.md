### Kanchenjunga [![Build Status](https://build.palaso.org/app/rest/builds/buildType:Fonts_Kanchenjunga/statusIcon)](https://build.palaso.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Fonts_Kanchenjunga&guest=1)

_The Kirat Rai script was officially encoded in the Unicode Standard version 16.0. Kanchenjunga version 1.000 was released in 2023 with provisional codepoints. However, those codepoints did not change, so if you used Kanchenjunga version 1.000, no data conversion will be necessary._
