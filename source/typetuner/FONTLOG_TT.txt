Kanchenjunga
===================


This file provides detailed information on the Kanchenjunga font.
This information should be distributed along with the Kanchenjunga font and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Kanchenjunga is a font family for the Kirat Rai script of South Asia. It is named after the third highest mountain in the world.

A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
----------------------------------------------------

The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Kanchenjunga" and "SIL" in
the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of 
Kanchenjunga. However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants 
through this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font
Names in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as 
long as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
"Kanchenjunga" is not the resulting font family name.

TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
"Kanchenjunga SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made 
with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Kanchenjunga" and "SIL" 
Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like "Sikkim Kirat Rai".
