# Kanchenjunga

_The Kirat Rai script was officially encoded in the Unicode Standard version 16.0. Kanchenjunga version 1.000 was released in 2023 with provisional codepoints. However, those codepoints did not change, so if you used Kanchenjunga version 1.000, no data conversion will be necessary._

Kanchenjunga is a font family for the Kirat Rai script of South Asia. It is named after the third highest mountain in the world.
