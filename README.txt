## Developer notes

This project uses a UFO-based design and production workflow, with all sources in open formats and a completely open-source build toolkit. For more details see [SIL Font Development Notes](https://silnrsi.github.io/silfontdev/en-US/Introduction.html).

We are not currently accepting contributions of glyph designs or code to this project, but if you are interested in helping with the project please contact us at fonts@sil.org.

The font can be built from source using [smith](https://github.com/silnrsi/smith). This is done via the sequence:

```
    smith distclean
    smith configure
    smith build
```
