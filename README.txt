# Kanchenjunga 

_The Kirat Rai script was officially encoded in the Unicode Standard version 16.0. Kanchenjunga version 1.000 was released in 2023 with provisional codepoints. However, those codepoints did not change, so if you used Kanchenjunga version 1.000, no data conversion will be necessary._

Kanchenjunga is a font family for the Kirat Rai script of South Asia. It is named after the third highest mountain in the world.

## Developer notes

This project uses a UFO-based design and production workflow, with all sources in open formats and a completely open-source build toolkit. For more details see [SIL Font Development Notes](https://silnrsi.github.io/silfontdev/en-US/Introduction.html).

We are not currently accepting contributions of glyph designs or code to this project, but if you are interested in helping with the project please contact us at fonts@sil.org.

The font can be built from source using [smith](https://github.com/silnrsi/smith). This is done via the sequence:

```
    smith distclean
    smith configure
    smith build
```
