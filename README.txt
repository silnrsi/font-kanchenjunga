# Kanchenjunga 

Kanchenjunga Test A is a font in development for the Kirat Rai script. **Please note that this is a work in progress so glyph shapes, metrics, and encoding will change.**

For more details about this project, including its design history and acknowledgements see [FONTLOG.txt](FONTLOG.txt).

For copyright and licensing information - including any Reserved Font Names - see [OFL.txt](OFL.txt).

For practical information about using, modifying and redistributing this font see [OFL-FAQ.txt](OFL-FAQ.txt).

_Please note that this font is not yet encoded according to The Unicode Standard, as the Kirat Rai script has not yet been accepted into the standard. The letters are currently given temporary assignments while encoding proposals are in process. Once the script is accepted into Unicode the encoding assignments may change._

## Developer notes

This project uses a UFO-based design and production workflow, with all sources in open formats and a completely open-source build toolkit. For more details see [SIL Font Development Notes](https://silnrsi.github.io/silfontdev/en-US/Introduction.html).

We are not currently accepting contributions of glyph designs or code to this project, but if you are interested in helping with the project please contact us at fonts@sil.org.

The font can be built from source using [smith](https://github.com/silnrsi/smith). This is done via the sequence:
```
    smith distclean
    smith configure
    smith build
```
See all the details in the [SIL Font Development Notes](https://silnrsi.github.io/silfontdev/en-US/Introduction.html).
